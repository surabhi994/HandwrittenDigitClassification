Handwritten Digit Classification Using Neural Networks

Implemented a Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network in Python and evaluated its performance in classifying handwritten digits. The data set used was MNIST data set consisting 60,000 training data. 
The same network was then used to analyze a more challenging face data set and the performance of the neural network was compared against a deep neural network using the Tensor Flow library. An accuracy of 97 % was achieved.
